This repository is for my COMS 327 class at Iowa State. There are three main files, Knights Tour, Pokemon, and PacMan. 

Knights Tour calculates how many moves it would take for a knight in chess to traverse a certain size board. This was a warm up project to become familiar with C.

The Pokemon game is my implementation of the traditional pokemon game playable in the terminal. The PC starts in the middle of the world and can choose a starter pokemon, battle pokemon, capture pokemon, heal pokemon, and revive pokemon. There are also trainer battles, pokemarts, and pokecenters. We spent 9 weeks on this project with a new requirement to add a component of the game each week. If a student's code was broken we had the choice to switch to the instructors code or fellow students code to stay caught up. I made it until week 8 before swapping over to a classmates code. The visible project is mostly code from another student with some final touches from myself and within the old projects folder includes my last working pokemon game version.

Finally, the last project we had the decision to make our own project or continue the pokemon game. I chose to make a terminal based Pacman game. The only improvements I plan to add later are ghost algorithms, extra screens between gameplay, fruit, and the highscore.
