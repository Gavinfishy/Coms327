Project 1
01/26/2024 9pm-11pm Began project
01/27/2024 2pm-5pm Set up basics of printing the map
01/28/2024 6pm-11pm Gates randomly placed, roads randomly placed and connected to each other and gate, perimeter rocks
01/29/2024 7pm-11pm Attempted to generate background (could randomly place types but could not get it to expand)
01/30/2024 5pm-7pm Randomly place buildings next to roads, changing background generation to use queues
01/30/2024 8:30pm-11pm can choose a starting location and the rest of the map will be filled using queues
01/31/2024 8am-10:30am Random seed generation works!

Project 2
02/03/2024 3pm-6pm Began project
02/04/2024 1pm-2:15pm, 4:15pm-6pm, 7:15pm-10:40pm The roads connect
02/05/2024 5pm-10pm gates on farthest walls do not appear
02/07/2024 2-4pm; 8:45-10pm probability on houses finished

Project 3
02/11/2024 2pm-4pm Spawning PC and NPC without errors moving maps
02/12/2024 9am-11am, 4pm-6pm, 8:30pm-10pm Weight maps for each character type, heaps and Dijkstra started
02/13/2024 3pm-7pm, 8:30pm-10:15pm minHeap and Dijkstra work and print properly
02/14/2024 9:30am-10:45am minor updates
02/17/2024 6pm-11pm trying to make Dijkstra's take an argument for any weight map
02/18/2024 1pm-5pm Dijkstra's takes any weight map, printing rival and hiker, removed enemy printing for this project,
changing characters from being placed in terrain map to being placed in character map
02/19/2024 9am-11am fixed error with previously generated maps sometimes printing all INT_MAX with PC in map struct

Project 4
02/24/2024 8:30am-10am, 9:30pm-11pm cleaned up repository so that all future code will be built with branches
Started to add other NPC's
02/25/2024 12pm-1pm, 2pm-4:30pm Commented code, made player movable, started to work on NPC movement
02/26/2024 10:30am-11:30am, 3:30pm-6pm, 8:15pm-10pm attempting to have NPC move correctly
02/27/2024 6am-7:45am, 9am-9:20am, 11am-12pm, 2pm-4:15pm One NPC can be added and follow the PC around following the
minimum path.
8pm-12:15pm Updating NPC's, multiple can be added. r, h, s work, p, s, e, w need work
02/28/2024 8am-11:30am, 7:45pm-10pm Wanderer fixed, all code works due to specifications

Project 5
02/29/2024 9:45am-t 10:45am Adding directionals to PC movement (diagonals)
03/12/2024 10pm-11pm added commands
03/18/2024 10am-11am, 3pm-5pm started to implement ncurses
03/19/2024 4pm-5pm, 9:30pm-11:30 ncurses printing working
03/20/2024 9am-11am, 12pm-1pm, 2:30pm-2am(rough) ncurses window started, will not print on first iteration.
8 and a half hours later the map prints on the first iteration.
trainer window open and close, store window open and close on stores

Project 6
TODO: Fix hiker and rival movement, scroll in tables, add back move maps and fly
03/24/2024 4pm-6:45pm, 8pm-9:30pm Converted to C++ minus structs to classes
03/25/2024 2pm-4pm, 10pm-11pm tried to fix true variable that won't change at office hours (battleReady), converted some structs to classes
03/26/2024 9am-10am, 2:30pm-6pm started to add back in move_maps and fly along with fixing input stream
03/27/2024 8:30am-11am, 2:30pm-6:45pm, 7pm-9:30pm can walk onto gate to transport maps, player placed in right spot, fly works
