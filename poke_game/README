This project is the implementation of a pokemon type game made in C.
Currently, a map is generated with a random background, borders, roads, buildings, and npc's
When pc moves r and h will aim for PC while w e p wander and s stands still
[You can traverse the world with n,e,s,w commands along with f x y where (x,y) is a coordinate in the map you would like to visit
Once a new portion of the map is generated you should always be able to go back to it]
