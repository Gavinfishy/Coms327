This project is the implementation of a pokemon type game made in C++.
Currently, a map is generated with a random background, borders, roads, buildings, and npc's

You can traverse the world by walking through gates on the sides of the map along with f x y then pressing the enter key where (x,y) is a coordinate in the world map you would like to visit
Once a new portion of the map is generated you should always be able to go back to it
