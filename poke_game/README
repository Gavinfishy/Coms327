This project is the implementation of a pokemon type game made in C.
Currently, a map is generated with a random background, borders, roads, buildings, and npc's
You can traverse the world with n,e,s,w commands along with f x y where (x,y) is a coordinate in the map you would like to visit
(^^^ This feature temporarily has been taken out for 1.04)
Once a new portion of the map is generated you should always be able to go back to it
CONTROLS:
h left
j down
k up
l right
cannot go diagonal yet. When pc moves on legal terrain r and h will aim for PC while w e p wander and s stands still
