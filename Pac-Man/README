This project is a C++ version of the classic pacman game
Ghosts currently have random movements
Eating a large pellet will make the ghosts eatable
Eating all of the pellets advances to the next level
Controls:
w,a,s,d or 8,4,2,6 for up, left, down, right respectfully
q during the run to quit the game

To run locally:
Clone the repository
Open the repository in a linux environment
Install ncurses:
    sudo apt install libncurses-dev
Compile the game:
    make
    ./pacman
    make clean

If that's a lot of work checkout this project redone on my portfolio site!
(coming soon)
