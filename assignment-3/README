This project is the implementation of a pokemon type game made in C.
Currently, a map is generated with a random background, borders, roads, buildings, and npc's
You can traverse the world with n,e,s,w commands along with f x y where (x,y) is a coordinate in the map you would like to visit
Once a new portion of the map is generated you should always be able to go back to it
in 1.03, the weight map of dijkstra's is printed below the map to give a visual idea of how npc's will move
